# HealthCrypto

## 💡 Inspiration

Our inspiration was to create an health platform where people can also earn rewards for their health related activities to keep motivating them. User are able to mint their data to earn tokens and spend them to get rewards. User can login with their FitBit user account to get their data listed for keeping track and also as a proof for their proper health.

## 💻 What it does

HealthCrypto is a decentralized platform that allows users to earn tokens for their health related activities. User's can also mint their data to earn an exclusive non-fungible token. If they so choose, this digital token and the encrypted data it represents can be held or "burned" for future discounts on healthcare services or insurance premiums. User need to loging with their FitBit account, acting as a "proof of health" creating an exclusive token/point system that we can either use to ensure adherence of patients to earn heart points to be used for various purpose.

## ⚙️How we built it

- ML: Python, Skikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Database: CockroachDB
- Authentication: Auth0
- IPFS: NFT Storage

## ☁ Best use of Linode Cloud

- We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake!
- Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.

## 🗃 Use of CockroachDB

- We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## 🔑 Best Use of Auth0

- We have used Auth0 for secure user authentication

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Reducing the size of the trained model was challenging for us. Bigger size meant that users have to wait a long time for obtaining prediction results and we would not be able to upload it on GitHub as well. We researched about the ways we can use to reduce model's size and found Quantization Aware Training to be useful and effective and we are glad it worked.
- As we were working with the blockchain tech for the first time if was bit difficult in the beginning but soon we were able to get it working.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing all these features in just two days is another.
- We are proud of our ability to use the latest technology and the best way to do it.

## 📖 What we learned

- Using Quantization Aware Training to reduce size of the model
- Integrate ML models directly without creating an API with Django
- Using NFT to store data
- Collaboration.

## 🚀 What's next for HealthCrypto

- Add more features and improve the UI.
- Adding a secure web-app to store data.
