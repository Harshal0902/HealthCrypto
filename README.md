# HealthCrypto

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️How we built it

- ML: Python, Skikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Database: CockroachDB
- Authentication: Auth0

## ☁ Best use of Linode Cloud

- We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake!
- Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.

## 🗃 Use of CockroachDB

- We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## 🔑 Best Use of Auth0

- We have used Auth0 for secure user authentication

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Reducing the size of the trained model was challenging for us. Bigger size meant that users have to wait a long time for obtaining prediction results and we would not be able to upload it on GitHub as well. We researched about the ways we can use to reduce model's size and found Quantization Aware Training to be useful and effective and we are glad it worked.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing all these features in just two days is another.

## 📖 What we learned

- Using Quantization Aware Training to reduce size of the model
- Integrate ML models directly without creating an API with Django
- Collaboration.
